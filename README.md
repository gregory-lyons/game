Game Name: Voyage to Venus

Backstory: An unmanned rover on Venus has discovered large pockets of an unidentified metal element.  Scientists are sending a manned mission to Venus for the first time, intending to retrieve samples of the metal for testing on Earth.  As pilot of the spacecraft, it is your job to safely navigate to Venus and then pilot the ship home.

Goal: To make two safe trips: from Earth to Venus (Level 1), and then from Venus back to Earth (Level 2).

Basic mechanics:  The background screen moves continuously to the left while the spaceship stays laterally suspended on the left side of the screen, giving the illusion of the ship's motion from left to right.  The up and down arrow keys will be used to move the ship vertically to avoid obstacles, such as asteroids, meteors, other spaceships, and projectiles fired by aliens.  The user's spaceship will also be equipped with a projectile weapon to fire at obstacles and destroy them.

Levels: The first level (Earth to Venus) will feature a meteor shower, which will include fast moving obstacles that the user must avoid.  The second level (Venus to Earth) will feature asteroids, which will be a series of large, slow moving obstalces to avoid.  The second level will also feature alien attackers firing projectiles at the user's spaceship.
